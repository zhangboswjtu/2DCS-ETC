# 2DCS-ETC scheme.
This code runs the experiments for 2D Compressed Sensing based Encryption-Then-Compression (2DCS-ETC) scheme. This is the main function of this scheme. The test images and some useful functions can be downloaded at dataset11 branch and mywork branch. The compressed file named TDCS-ETC.rar contains the main function, WaveletSoftware, the useful functions and the test images. For more details of this scheme, please refer to the following paper.
